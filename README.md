# IoT-Enabled Water Quality Monitoring Devices

This project focuses on building IoT-enabled devices to monitor water quality in real-time. It aims to provide a cost-effective and scalable solution for ensuring safe and sustainable water resources.

## 🌊 Overview

Water pollution is a global concern, and constant monitoring is crucial. This project leverages IoT sensors and microcontrollers to detect and transmit key water quality parameters such as:

- pH Level
- Turbidity
- Temperature
- Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
- Electrical Conductivity (EC)
- Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Hardware:**
  - Arduino/ESP32 microcontroller
  - pH sensor
  - Turbidity sensor
  - Temperature sensor (DS18B20)
  - Wi-Fi/Bluetooth modules

- **Software:**
  - Arduino IDE
  - Python (for data visualization)
  - Thingspeak / Blynk / Firebase (for cloud storage)
  - Mobile app/web dashboard for real-time monitoring

## ⚙️ Features

- Real-time water quality monitoring
- Cloud integration for data logging
- Alert system for unsafe water levels
- Mobile/web dashboard for user interface
- Low-power design for remote usage

## 🌐 Use Cases

- Monitoring drinking water supplies
- Aquaculture and fish farming
- Industrial wastewater monitoring
- River and lake health assessment
